= 1.3 |  Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

*The Business Impact Analysis is the foundation of any Business Continuity Plan.  The purpose of the BIA is to pinpoint the processes crucial to the continued operations and delivery of technologies to the organization.*

*The Business Impact Analysis is based on a worse-case, total outage of Wells' corporate data center and operating from the Security Institute on WITCC's campus.*

*Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) are two of the most important terms in the Business Impact Analysis.*

- RTO - the targeted duration of time in which systems must be restored after a disaster or outage event.

- RTO designates the amount of "real time" that can pass before the disruption begins to seriously impede the flow of normal business operations.

- RPO – the amount of time between the last 'data save' and the amount of data that could be lost during a disaster event.

- RPO designates the variable "amount of data" that will be lost or will have to be re-entered during an outage event.
