== Preface
Wells Enterprises, Inc. has a comprehensive Disaster Recovery plan in place.  A Disaster Recovery site is maintained 30 miles from our Corporate data center.  Company information systems are backup up routinely according to Wells' internal IT controls policy; either several times a day, daily or weekly according to the type of data and importance.  System backups are replicated off-line to a virtual tape library.  In addition, critical company transactional data is actively replicated to the disaster recovery site on a continual basis.  The disaster recovery plan calls for the full recovery of all business critical systems according to their criticality; within 8 hours, 12 hours or 24 hours.  The plan procedure is tested quarterly, with a full disaster recovery test scheduled annually.
