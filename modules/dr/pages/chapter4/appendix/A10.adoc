[NOTE]
*Shutdown ALL services on Solarwinds01 For DR Devices*


== FAIL OVER TO TEST STATE

. Shutdown Vlan198 on DR-N9k
. Physical task on DR-WAN-RTR unplug interface G0/1 (1G connection to Lemars) (ON BACK)
. Physical task on DR-WAN-RTR  (unplug connection to MPLS network S1/1:1.64) (FORNT PORT1)
. Physical task on DR-ASA unplug G0/0 (30M connection to the internet)
. Console into (Cisco console cable using USB -> DB9 connector) and Login to DRN9K (might need to used CW2k creds)
- “IP Route 172.26.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.27.96.10” (DMZ-ROUTING)
- Bring up interface E130/1/21 via no shut
- Bring up interface E130/1/22 via no shut
- Verify routing table "sho ip rou" and "sho ip rou vrf  DR-VRF" sho int vlan 60, sho int vlan 61
- You should now see 172.23.5,6,10,110,150.x networks in the routing table.
. Bring up the Switch in the class room.
- DRN9k  int E140/1/23 no shut
- DRN9k  int E140/1/24 no shut


. Bring UP DMZ
- Connect to DR-ASA-A / Bring up DMZ
- DR-ASA-A<CONFIG>#int gig 0/3 <enter>
- DR-ASA-A<CONFIG-IF>#no shut <enter>
- DR-ASA-A<CONFIG-IF>#int gig 0/0 <enter>
- ip address 204.126.23.130 255.255.254.0
- Connect Micro-switch from int g0/0 on DR-ASA-A  (int g0/0 is currenty in DR-BBGTW g0/1)
- Assign testing ip addresses to users (204.126.22.x/23)
NOTES:
• Outside addresses for DMZ testing:  204.126.22.55-65 or 204.126.23.55-65
• DR-USER DHCP Scope is in VLAN1

== Return to Normal STATE (NON_DR_TEST)

. Login in to DR-ASA-A
- Shut down  Interface GigabitEthernet0/3 "DMZ"
- interface GigabitEthernet0/0 ip address 204.126.23.130 255.255.255.128
- disconnect Micro-switch from int g0/0 on DR-ASA-A and move back to  DR-BBGTW g0/1
. Login to DR-ASW-A
- Shut Down interface E 130/1/21
- Shut Down interface E 130/1/22
- Shut Down interface E 1/40/1/23 (DR Classroom switch port)
- Shut Down interface E 1/40/1/24 (DR Classroom switch port)
- No IP Route 172.26.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.27.96.10
- CLEAR IP ROUTE *
- Bring UP interface VLAN198
. Login to DR-WAN-RTR
- CLEAR IP ROUTE *
- Verify the routes are correct


. “Physical task on DR-WAN-RTR patch in interface G0/1 (200M to Le Mars) (ON BACK)
. Physical task on DR-WAN-RTR  patch in interface for S1/1:1.64 for MPLS ( FRONT PORT1)
. Physical task on DR-ASA patch in  G0/0 (30M connection to the internet)
. Verify the routes are correct
