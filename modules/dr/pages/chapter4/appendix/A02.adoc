==  Setting Correct DNS in resolv.conf File

*The servers we use for DNS resolution at the corporate office are different than the servers we use at DR so we need to point the VM to the DR DNS servers. To do this you need to edit the /etc/resolv.conf file. This change will not persist through a reboot. If you need to reboot the VM you will need to make the change again.*

*1. Login to the console as the root user.*

image::A02-12.jpg[]

*2. Open the /etc/resolv.conf file with the vi editor.*

----
# vi /etc/resolv.conf
----

The file should look like this:
----
# Generated by NetworkManager
search bluebunny.com
nameserver 172.23.10.113
nameserver 173.27.98.101
nameserver 172.23.10.69
options attempts: 2
options timeout: 1
# NOTE: the libc resolver may not support more than 3 nameservers.
# The nameservers listed below may not be recognized.
nameserver 172.27.98.102
----

*3. Use the "j" key to move down to the first nameserver line. Then type "dd" to delete the line. The first name server listed should be 172.27.98.101.*

If the "nameserver 172.27.98.101" line does not exist use the "j" key to move down to the first nameserver line. Type "i" to enter input mode. Then type "nameserver 172.27.98.101<ENTER>". Press the <ESC> key to get out of input mode.

*4. Save the file by type ":wq"*

*5. Type "exit" to logout.
