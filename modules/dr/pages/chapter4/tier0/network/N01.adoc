IMPORTANT: xref:chapter4/tier0/storage/S01.adoc[S01] must be completed before this step.
===================

*N01 - N04 takes roughly 55 minutes to complete*

*DR-ASW-A (172.27.96.131)*

For a DR Test - Refer to xref:chapter4/appendix/A10.adoc[Appendix - A10] ( Network DR Test Only Steps )

For an actual DR Event there are 2 options:
1) we have access to a classroom or
2) we must perform all work in the data center.

Wherever our work area is, the infrastructure cabling must be configured by Long Lines staff so Wells can connect to our equipment in a classroom.

If we work in the datacenter, we'll put a switch on a table and run cables with which to connect laptops.

== Classroom

1. WHAT SWITCH, CABLE - LOCATION TERA TERM, USER/PASSWORD (stays in datacenter not on network)  [red]#(Label all equipment)#
2. connect console -> open tera term -> choose serial -> select comm port -> enter
3. prompt to enter password pops up -> > shows up -> enter 'en' (to enable) -> enter
4. enter next password (high security) -> # appears -> start commands
