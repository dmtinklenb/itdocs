= Ransomware Recovery

== Data Recovery from AWS

This article outlines the steps required to recover virtual machines, databases, NFS shares and file server data from the Veeam capacity tier in AWS.

These steps would be used if any server, database or Veeam backup files have been corrupted by ransomware.

=== Basic VM Restore from AWS

[NOTE]
Each virtual machine has its own backup file.  Veeam will only restore a VM from AWS backup files if the required backup file is no longer available in the local repository.

. Remove the corrupted local backup file for the VM you need to restore.
.. In Veeam B&R Console -> Home -> Backups -> Disk, find the VM you need to restore, right-click on its backup file and select Delete from Disk.
